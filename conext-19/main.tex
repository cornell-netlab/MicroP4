\section{Challenges}
P4 is developed to specify data plane functionality of software or hardware targets (e.g., simple\_\-switch~\cite{simple_switch.md}, TOFINO~\cite{tofino} etc.,) devices.
Target device manufacturer provides an architecture description of data plane along with a P4 compiler for the device.
The architecture source file (e.g., v1model.p4~\cite{v1model.p4} for simple\_switch) contains declaration of a set of pro\-gram\-ma\-ble blocks, their data plane interfaces and the target specific metadata (called intrinsic metadata) and extern functions.
To program the packet processing pipeline of a device, P4 programmers provide implementation of the declared programmable blocks in its architecture file.
Therefore, P4 programs are tightly coupled with architecture of the target devices.


The architecture description of a target specifies data plane pipeline comprising a set of pro\-gram\-ma\-ble and fixed-function blocks, flow of user-defined and target-specific (called intrinsic) metadata in the pipeline and semantics of target-specific actions and externs.
For example, Figure~\ref{subfig:psa-model} and~\ref{subfig:v1model} show data plane pipelines and their packet processing blocks defined in v1model~\cite{simple_switch.md} and Portable Switch Architecture (PSA)~\cite{psa}, respectively.

\end{figure}


Parser blocks are described using a sub-language of P4, based on abstraction of Finite State Machine.
Control blocks are expressed using a sub-language modelling imperative control-flow.
Deparser are special control blocks that allows to use statements, to reassemble packets, that are not prohibited in other control blocks.
Packet processing logic in P4 programs are sectioned across programmable blocks with heterogeneous abstract machines (e.g., parsers, deparsers, control) and fixed-function blocks (Packet Buffer and Replication Engine).
Therefore, a control block can not instantiate and execute parser blocks. Similarly, deparser block can not invoke and execute parser blocks.  
Consider the example in Figure~\ref{fig:l3.p4.l2.p4}, at the end of deparser control block ``D'' of l3.p4, parser ``P'' of l2.p4 can not be executed.


Moreover, architectures models expose intrinsic metadata, target-specific actions and extern functions (e.g., resubmit, recirculate, clone) to replicate and/or program packet-path and flow of data across the processing blocks, as described in~\cite{simple_switch.md} and ~\cite{psa}
In turn, adding different abstract-machine to program packet-path and data flow across the blocks and further increasing heterogeneity in the model of a data plane program.
<<For example, resubmit or recirculate calls are like event trigger.. effects happen after the block>>

Finally, the existing architecture models expose target-specific constraints.
E.g., output port can not be changed in egress control block, scope of some intrinsic metadata bounded by particular programmable blocks, etc.,  
Programmers need implement execution logic conforming to constraints, architecture model and semantics of actions and extern functions of the target device.


% P4 programmers need to implement homogeneous blocks (e.g., ingress and egress control) satisfying different accessibility constraints on intrinsic metadata exposed by the architecture. 
Due to absence of uniform abstract machine for a program and presence of target-specific constraints, composition of data plane program modules is extremely difficult, even for the same target. 
Also, existing compilers and architecture specifications do not provide simplified and common abstractions for packet processing blocks in data plane to facilitate target agnostic reuse of data plane programs.


First, we simplify abstract machine for P4 data plane programs by reducing code fragmentation and number of programmable blocks.
Second, we abstract out fixed-function blocks by deriving logical externs.
Third, we develop compiler mechanisms to have uniform abstract-machine for programmable blocks.
Finally, we translate our unified abstract machine and logical externs into real target-specific heterogeneous packet-processing blocks, features and constraints.

In section~\ref{section:micros-awitch-architecture}, we explain the design of Micro Switch Architecture for a logical target that reduces number of programmable blocks and introduces logical externs to minimize heterogeneity in abstract model of P4 programs.

\section{Micros P4}

overview:


Define types of composition: 
Sequential
Parallel


What do we need to provide interface to code modules?

We need runtime behaviour with package. 
packet, sm, es, inargs, inout args -> package -> packet, sm, es, out args, inout args
P4 extended to 
allow Define new Package types
runtime behavior with package types

MicroP4 defines package interfaces.


MicroP4 captures intrinsic metadata dependency of real targets using logical extern (egress\_spec)

MicroP4 defines common abstractions for target specific operations that can not be expressed in P4
e.g., multicast



Micro P4 higher-level description and usage:

% \caption{Runtime Behavior of Package Types}

% \end{figure}

Architecture model of real targets provides a default path, comprising of processing blocks, for packet and data in data plane pipeline.
Programmers can use target-specific externs to change the default path and route the packet through required processing block.
Intuitively, we can say that the packet-processing code is stationary whereas packet and data are propagated through the stationary code blocks in pipeline.
P4 compiler backends of real targets mandates programmers to map logic and provide code for different processing units in data plane instead of automatically allocating code to the units. 

Micro-Switch Architecture, $\mu$SA, is designed with completely opposite philosophy.
$\mu$SA provides abstraction to avail features of maximum processing blocks at any stage of execution-control of a program and $\mu$P4C compiler transforms code according to the abstractions to allocate on stationary processing blocks of the real target device.
