## Examples from SIGCOMM '20 paper
To reproduce the examples from our SIGCOMM '20 paper, see the code and
instructions here:
[extensions/csa/msa-examples](https://github.com/cornell-netlab/MicroP4/tree/master/extensions/csa/msa-examples).
In short, there are 7 composed programs mentioned in the paper. All of them can
be compiler using a single Makefile as mentioned in the README.


## Details
There are two steps in using μP4:

1. Writing μP4 programs: See [this page](https://github.com/cornell-netlab/MicroP4#3-how-to-write-%CE%BCp4-programs) for instructions on writing new programs.
2. Compiling μP4 programs: See [this page](https://github.com/cornell-netlab/MicroP4#4-how-to-use-%CE%BCp4c) for instructions on compiling μP4 programs with μP4C.
