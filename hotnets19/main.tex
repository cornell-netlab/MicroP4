\begin{abstract}
Domain-specific languages such as P4 enable flexible and efficient
packet-processing using primitives such as programmable parsers and
re-configurable match-action tables. However, the P4 ecosystem exposes
details of the underlying architecture, which ties programs to
specific architectures and makes it difficult to write composeable
libraries of code that can be reused across many different programs.

To address this challenge, we present the design and implementation of
a logical target, MicroP4 ($\mu$P4), that decouples P4 programs from
architecture-specific constructs and naturally supports composition.
We present the design of the $\mu$P4 architecture ($\mu$SA), which
abstracts away from hardware-level details without sacrificing
expressiveness. Using realistic examples, we show how $\mu$P4 enables
modular programming, and we present a prototype implementation of the
$\mu$P4C compiler that generates code for lower-level architectures
such as PISA, which is implemented by the Bmv2 software switch.

\section{Challenges}
P4 is developed to specify data plane functionality of software or hardware targets (e.g., simple\_\-switch \cite{simple_switch.md}, TOFINO \cite{tofino} etc.,) devices.
Target device manufacturer provides an architecture description of data plane along with a P4 compiler for the device.
The architecture source file (e.g., v1\-mod\-el\-.p4 \cite{v1model.p4} for simple\_switch) contains declaration of a set of pro\-gram\-ma\-ble blocks, their data plane interfaces and the target specific metadata (called intrinsic metadata) and extern functions.
To program the packet processing pipeline of a device, P4 programmers provide implementation of the declared programmable blocks in its architecture file.
Therefore, P4 programs are tightly coupled with architecture of the target devices.

The architecture description of a target specifies data plane pipeline comprising a set of pro\-gram\-ma\-ble and fixed-function blocks, flow of user-defined and target-specific (called intrinsic) metadata in the pipeline and semantics of target-specific actions and externs.
For example, Figure \ref{subfig:psa-model} and \ref{subfig:v1model} show data plane pipelines and their packet processing blocks defined in v1model \cite{simple_switch.md} and Portable Switch Architecture (PSA) \cite{psa}, respectively.


Parser blocks are described using a sub-language of P4, based on abstraction of Finite State Machine.
Control blocks are expressed using a sub-language modelling imperative control flow.
Deparsers are special control blocks that allows to use statements, to reassemble packets, that are prohibited in other control blocks.
Packet processing logic in P4 programs are sectioned across programmable blocks with heterogeneous abstract machines (e.g., parsers, deparsers, control) and fixed-function blocks (Packet Buffer and Replication Engine).
Therefore, a control block can not instantiate and execute parser blocks. Similarly, deparser block can not invoke and execute parser blocks.  
Consider the example in Figure \ref{fig:l3.p4.l2.p4}, parser ``P'' of l2.p4 can not be executed at the end of deparser control block ``D'' of l3.p4.


Moreover, architectures models expose intrinsic metadata, target-specific actions and extern functions (e.g., resubmit, recirculate, clone) to replicate and/or program packet-path and flow of data across the processing blocks, as described in \cite{simple_switch.md} and  \cite{psa}
In turn, adding different abstract-machine to program packet-path and data flow across the blocks and further increasing heterogeneity in the model of a data plane program.
<<For example, resubmit or recirculate calls are like event trigger.. effects happen after the block>>

Finally, the existing architecture models expose target-spe\-cific constraints to programmers.
E.g., output port can not be changed in egress control block, scope of some intrinsic metadata limited to specific programmable blocks, etc.,  
Programmers need implement execution logic conforming to constraints, architecture model and semantics of actions and extern functions of the target device.


% P4 programmers need to implement homogeneous blocks (e.g., ingress and egress control) satisfying different accessibility constraints on intrinsic metadata exposed by the architecture. 

The absence of a uniform abstract machine for packet processing and presence of target-specific constraints have made extremely difficult to enable modularity.
Because, modularity requires mechanisms to develop independent code modules and interface to reuse them without requiring to know their implementation detail.
Also, existing compilers and architecture specifications do not provide simplified and common abstractions for packet processing blocks in data plane to facilitate target agnostic reuse of data plane programs.


% In section \ref{section:micros-awitch-architecture}, we explain the design of Micro Switch Architecture for a logical target that reduces number of programmable blocks and introduces logical externs to minimize heterogeneity in abstract model of P4 programs.
